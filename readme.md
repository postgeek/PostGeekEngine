TODO
  - Add the inputs as potential middleware to be able to add different input devices?

Notes
==================
- Change the asset loader and cache so that loading an asset is seemless to the user.
- Notify observers that all assets have been loaded. (Example to start the scene)
- Something like Assets.load(key, path); or Assets.put(key, path) or Assets.add(key, path)
